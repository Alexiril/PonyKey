# PonyKey
Just a little game, designed and programmed for being nice, cute, and hard. The gameplay is to push keys on your keyboard as fast as possible.

**The game is under hard development!**

# How to build the game
First of all, you need to have C# (10.0) compiler. Second thing is python 3.  
You don't need to install any additional packages / libraries for python, the building script uses only built-in 
modules.

You need to open the PonyKey.sln file in your IDE (Visual studio, JetBrains Rider, or anything else) and click Run.  
Solution does have two possible ways to build: Debug (to debug, duh) and Release.
Release option changes code slightly. If you want to only start and play, you need to choose this option.
